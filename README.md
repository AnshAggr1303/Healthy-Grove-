# HealthyGrove - Plant Disease Detection and Solutions

## Overview
The Plant Disease Detection and Solutions Android application leverages image detection models to analyze plant diseases across 38 different classes. By utilizing advanced machine learning algorithms, this app provides accurate identification of plant diseases and offers corresponding solutions to help users effectively manage and mitigate plant health issues.

## Features
- **Image Detection Model**: Utilizes state-of-the-art image detection models to accurately identify plant diseases from images captured by the user.
- **38 Disease Classes**: Covers a wide range of plant diseases across 38 different classes, including common pathogens affecting various plant species.
- **Solution Recommendations**: Provides tailored solutions and recommendations for each identified plant disease to assist users in managing and treating affected plants effectively.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Offers a user-friendly interface designed for intuitive navigation and seamless user experience.

## How It Works
1. **Image Capture**: Users capture images of plants displaying symptoms of disease using their device's camera within the app.
2. **Image Analysis**: The captured images are processed through the image detection model to identify the specific plant disease.
3. **Solution Provision**: Upon disease identification, the app provides users with detailed information about the detected disease and recommends appropriate solutions and treatment methods.
4. **Database Integration**: Utilizes a comprehensive database of plant diseases and corresponding solutions to provide accurate and reliable recommendations.
